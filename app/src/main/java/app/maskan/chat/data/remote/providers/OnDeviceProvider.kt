/**
 * The thirteenth provider, and the only one with no server behind it.
 *
 * A provider and not a mode, deliberately: the model picker, folder instructions, memory,
 * documents, "Answer again", the cost prompt and the whole request assembly already work
 * through this interface, and a separate "offline mode" would have meant reimplementing every
 * one of them slightly differently. Picking it with no model downloaded opens the download
 * card; picking another provider afterwards is how someone goes back to their own key, and
 * that path already exists.
 *
 * What is different from every other provider, and why:
 *
 *  - **No API key.** `requiresApiKey` is false because there is nothing to have a key WITH.
 *  - **`isLocal`**, so documents are chunked at the local sizes, and **`contextTokens`**, so the
 *    request budget is derived from the window this file was actually built with (4,096) rather
 *    than from a constant chosen for "a local model" in the abstract.
 *  - **`canAutoTitle` is false unless the model is already in memory.** Naming a chat is a
 *    question the user did not ask, and loading 1.6 GB to answer it - possibly after they have
 *    left the app - is not a trade anyone would accept.
 *  - **No image, no vision, no video.** The `.task` this ships is text only.
