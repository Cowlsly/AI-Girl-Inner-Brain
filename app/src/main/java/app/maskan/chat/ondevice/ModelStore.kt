 * Where a downloaded model lives, what it costs, and how to get rid of it.
 *
 * Everything about the file on disk is here rather than spread between the worker, the engine
 * and the screen, because three of the four questions this answers are ones the user is owed a
 * true number for: how much space this takes, how much comes back when they delete it, and
 * whether their phone can run it at all.
 *
 * `filesDir/models/` and not the cache directory: the system evicts a cache under pressure, and
 * a 1.6 GB download that the OS may silently throw away is not a download anyone should be
 * asked to make.
