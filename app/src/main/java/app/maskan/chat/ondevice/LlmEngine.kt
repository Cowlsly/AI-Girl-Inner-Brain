/**

 *
 * One instance, created lazily, never two: a `.task` is one and a half gigabytes of mapped
 * weights and a second copy is an out-of-memory kill. Generation is serialised on a mutex for
 * the same reason, which also makes "is the model busy" answerable.
 *
 * It lets go of the model on [release] - called from onTrimMemory and by an idle timer - because
 * an app the user has left holding a gigabyte is an app the system kills, and the next question
 * would then pay the load twice.
