/**
 * The models this app knows how to run, pinned in the app itself.
 *
 * Pinned rather than fetched: the sha256 is what makes "downloaded from the internet and then
 * loaded into a native runtime" safe to do at all, and a checksum served from the same place as
 * the file it describes checks nothing. A new model means a new release.
 *
 * [contextTokens] is the window the FILE was built with, not a preference. These files are
 * published in several builds and the name says which: `ekv1280` and `ekv4096` are the same
 * weights with a different KV cache. Everything the request assembly is allowed to spend is
 * derived from this number (see ChatRepository.budgetFor), so it has to be the truth about the
 * file, and a file whose sha256 does not match is never loaded.

     * Qwen2.5 1.5B Instruct, 8-bit, with a 4,096-token window. **The model 2.6.0 ships.**
     *
     * Chosen over Gemma on measurement, not on paper (the four-model table is in
     * Maskan/2.6_sessions/ondevice_measurements.md). Gemma 3 1B is fast and answers
     * `ما عاصمة الأردن؟` with `القدس`; Gemma 3n E2B answers it correctly and writes at under
     * two tokens a second on a flagship. Qwen answers it correctly at 7.9-12.5 tok/s and loads
     * in under a second warm.
     *
     * It is also **Apache 2.0**, which removes the anti-feature question Gemma's licence raised
     * with F-Droid. Nothing about this model has to be asked of anyone.
     *
     * Provenance, checked three ways rather than assumed: the laptop file, the copy in
     * `filesDir/models/` on the Pixel, and the sha256 Hugging Face publishes for
     * `Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct_multi-prefill-seq_q8_ekv4096.task` are the same
     * 1,598,556,720 bytes and the same hash. The published name is kept exactly, because a
     * renamed file is a file whose provenance has to be explained.
     *
     * There is no int4 build: litert-community publishes this model as f32 and q8 only. An int4
     * would be about half the size, and converting one ourselves would mean shipping a hash of
     * our own build rather than of a published artifact. Not done, on purpose.
